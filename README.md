  Figma was already set up for the Spots project with a layout to work with on my own coding. I used the figma frames to help me with my css files and further my comprehension on responsive designing.

**Images**

My images were exported from the Figma frames already set up for me; and every button, pencil, heart, and image was recieved my downloaded Figma images
